# Homework
Declare a variable called n: n = 50
Declare a variable called sum: sum = 0
Declare a variable called f1: f1 = 1
Declare a variable called f2: f2 = 1
Set sum to 0: This is accomplished in the declaration (sum = 0).
Set f1 and f2 to 1: This is accomplished in the declarations (f1 = 1 and f2 = 1).
Set n to 50: This is accomplished in the declaration (n = 50).
Repeat loop n times: The for loop repeats n times.
a. sum = f1 + f2: Calculates the sum of f1 and f2.
b. f2 = f1: Updates f2 to the value of f1.
c. f1 = sum: Updates f1 to the value of sum.
d. print sum: Prints the current value of sum.
End loop: The loop ends naturally after iterating n times.
